    <!-- The target tag is used to specify to open the links in a new tab. By default it use _self -->
    <!-- The rel tag use two values here : 
        noopener :  value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened
        noreferrer : value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it
